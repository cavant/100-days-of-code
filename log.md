# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup (VS 2017, nuget packages) contemplate mod deas

**Thoughts:** I am very excited about this challenge. I love my job, but currently it does not offer a ton of opportunities to work on any .Net code and zero opportunities to work on anything game related (at least while still getting work done heehee) But this will give me a chance to work on tryting to create mods for a game that I both enjoy and am impressed by, Stardew Valley.

Today reminded me that while I can read through .Net code fairly well and parse out what it is doing, I am quite rusty at it. It is something I hope to improve upon throughout this process and I hope that I come out of it a more well rounded and capable developer

### Day 3: January 24, 2019

**Todays Progress**: Did not log yesterday but all I worked on was struggling a little with the Visual Studio Environment.

**Thoughts**: Issues with creating the type of solution I needed for the mods both yesterday and today. The Visual Studio components that I needed were not installed which caused the problem. Played around with the nuget package made to work with SMAPI (The Stardew Moddding API). This allows you to easily access objects in the game for manipulation.
