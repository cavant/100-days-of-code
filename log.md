# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup (VS 2017, nuget packages) contemplate mod deas

**Thoughts:** I am very excited about this challenge. I love my job, but currently it does not offer a ton of opportunities to work on any .Net code and zero opportunities to work on anything game related (at least while still getting work done heehee) But this will give me a chance to work on tryting to create mods for a game that I both enjoy and am impressed by, Stardew Valley.

Today reminded me that while I can read through .Net code fairly well and parse out what it is doing, I am quite rusty at it. It is something I hope to improve upon throughout this process and I hope that I come out of it a more well rounded and capable developer
