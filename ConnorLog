I will use this to keep track of my progress throughout 100 days of code.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

My focus will be on trying to develop mods for Stardew Valley, a game I enjoy and one that intrigues me as a developer

### Day 1: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 1. Download and install VS 2017 as welll as the nuget packages that provide toolkits for this purpose
                      2. Research into what I feel I would enjoy having as a mod on Stardew
